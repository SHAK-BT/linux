ELVEES Avico (a.k.a. VELcore-01)
--------------------------------

Avico is a VPU (Video Processing Unit) designed by RnD Center ELVEES.
It supports encoding and decoding several video streams simultaneously.

Required properties:

- compatible: Should be "elvees,avico".
- reg: Should contain two memory regions: register region and
  VRAM scratchpad memory region.
- interrupts: Should contain the VPU interrupt.
- clocks: Should contain the "pclk", "aclk", and "sclk" clocks, in the order
  determined by the clock-names property.
- clock-names: Should be "pclk", "aclk", and "sclk".

Example:

vpu: codec@37100000 {
	compatible = "elvees,avico";
	reg = <0x37100000 0x00010000>, <0x3b000000 0x01000000>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 7 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clocks = <&vpu_pclk>, <&vpu_aclk>, <&vpu_sclk>;
	clock-names = "pclk", "aclk", "sclk";
};
