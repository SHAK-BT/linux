Required properties:
- compatible: should be "elvees,mcom-pwm".
- reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers
- #pwm-cells: Should be 2. See pwm.txt in this directory for a
  description of the cells format.
- clocks: phandle to the PWM source clocks

	pwm: pwm@0x38090000 {
		compatible = "elvees,mcom-pwm";
		reg = <0x38090000 0x1000>;
		#pwm-cells = <2>;
		clocks = <&pwm_pclk>;
	};
